            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I am a recently graduated engineer, and I am very excited to use everything I learned during the last four years of my studies.
                I studied Computational Robotics at the Universidad Politécnica de Yucatán.
                I have knowledge in areas like programming, electronics, mechanics, and other fields related to robotics.</p>
            <p>I have built different types of robots, such as robotic arms, autonomous robots, and fun robots like combat or maze-solving robots.
                Right now, I am also working as an industrial mechanic to gain experience in the professional world.
                This job has helped me learn many things I could not learn at school.</p>
            <p>As a personal project, I decided to create a website to organize and show everything I have done.
                I want to grow both professionally and personally, so doing projects like this really motivates me.
                I hope you like it, and thank you for reading.</p>
